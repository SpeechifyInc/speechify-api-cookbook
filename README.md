# Speechify Cookbook

Focused, runnable recipes for the Speechify
[Text-to-Speech](https://docs.speechify.ai/tts) API.

Each recipe is small, self-contained, and does one thing — copy a folder, add your API
key, and run it.

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Get an API key: https://console.speechify.ai/api-keys
# 2. Pick a recipe below and follow its README.
```

The fastest path:

```bash
cd recipes/audio/typescript/sdk/quickstart
cp .env.example .env        # paste your SPEECHIFY_API_KEY
pnpm install && pnpm start  # writes output.mp3
```

## Recipes

Recipes are organized by **product → language → flavor → recipe**:

```
recipes/<product>/<language>/{sdk,native}/<recipe>/
```

- **SDK** — uses an official Speechify SDK for that language.
- **Native** — calls the REST API directly (no SDK), e.g. `fetch` in TS, `requests` in Python, `curl` in Bash.

### Audio — TypeScript

## Repository layout

```
recipes/audio/<language>/{sdk,native}/<recipe>/
```

- `audio/` — Text-to-Speech today; the audio platform will expand.
- `<language>` — `typescript`, `python`, and `bash` (curl-only, native flavor).
- `sdk` — uses the official Speechify SDK for that language.
- `native` — calls the REST API directly (no SDK).

This is a **pnpm workspace** monorepo. TypeScript/JavaScript recipes are workspace members
(shared dependency versions via the pnpm `catalog:`); Python recipes use **uv** and are
managed per-recipe.

| `recipes/`   | The recipes themselves.                                                   |
| `templates/` | Copy-to-start scaffolds for new recipes.                                  |
| `agents/`    | Modular maintenance/usage instructions, loaded on demand via `AGENTS.md`. |
| `AGENTS.md`  | Entry point for AI agents and contributors.                               |

## Tooling

- **Node 20+** and **pnpm** for JavaScript/TypeScript recipes.
- **Python 3.10+** and **[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)** for Python recipes.
- `pnpm install` at the root sets up all JS recipes.
- `pnpm format` formats the repo with Prettier.
